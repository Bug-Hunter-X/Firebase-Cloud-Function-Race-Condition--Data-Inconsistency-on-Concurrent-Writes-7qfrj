The issue stems from a race condition within a Cloud Function triggered by a Firebase Realtime Database write.  Specifically, the function attempts to access and modify data concurrently from multiple clients, leading to inconsistent state.  The function uses `onWrite` trigger and directly updates data based on the changes. The problem manifests when two clients write data almost simultaneously. The function may process the second write before fully completing the first, resulting in data loss or incorrect values.
